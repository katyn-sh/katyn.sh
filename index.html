                    <h3>Day 1</h3>
                    <p>A trip that's been in the oven for ages. For some reason, I decided that China would be my first 3 week trip, and that I would be able to "pace" ourselves better than our previous trips. Spending 12 hours airports and 20 hours in planes just to get to Hong Kong was nice foreshadowing for how much of a marathon this trip would be.</p>
                    <p>Trying to figure out rail transport after this ordeal was tough even with all of the research I did beforehand. I wasn't really in the mood to get my face ripped off by the Hong Kong International Airport ATM exchange rates, so we stood around trying to download the Octopus app to pay for our fares.</p>
                    <p>The Airport Express, running from the artificial island of Chek Lap Kok was built in the 90s to connect the new airport to Kowloon and Hong Kong Island and was quite innovative at the time. As far as I can tell, it was the first airport rail link to introduce in-town check-in, which allows passengers to drop off their checked baggage in the city center and have it delivered to the airport and their plane.</p>
                    <p>For our usecase, being able to freely transfer to the Hong Kong MTR system with our fare was great perk, since I definitely didn't have the energy to faff about with buying single-ride tickets after such a long journey.</p>
                    <p>We stayed at The Salisbury - YMCA of Hong Kong at the very tip of Kowloon Peninsula. I initially chose it because it's right smack on top of East Tsim Sha Tsui and Tsim Sha Tsui Stations, but I quickly realized that it was still quite a trek to actually get to the metro platforms at either station.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, Kowloon is the older half of the city of Hong Kong. Most of the glistening skyscrapers that make up the skyline are on Hong Kong Island proper, with some notable exceptions. That being said, you can typically find more traditional ethnic food shops on the peninsula, compared with more malls and more global restaurants on the island.</p>
                    <p>Our first meal was dim sum recommended by our concierge. It was pretty good, but because of space (and maybe staffing) constraints, no dim sum cart was involved. I don't believe that having a dim sum cart is really necessary for "authenticity", it's just that people back home have an outdated opinion on what traditional Cantonese restaurant is. In a city like Hong Kong, that idea has long been abstracted away.</p>
                    <p>As a part of our contractually-obligated vacation death march, we made our way up Nathan Road while fighting the fatigue of jetlag. As I like to collect metro and stored-value cards on my trips, we each acquired a Hong Kong Octopus card. Although this was technically the 2nd contactless smart card introduced, it's the oldest still in use as South Korea's Upass was obsoleted less than a decade after its introduction. As with the airport and the Hong Kong MTR itself, the introduction of the Octopus card is another example of the peak of British engineering.</p>
                    <p>After visiting Kowloon Walled City Park (overrated), buying grey market camera gear (underrated) and eating Japanese food not in Japan, we made our way down the harbor along the Avenue of Stars before turning in.</p>

                    <h3>Day 2</h3>
                    <p>For the second death march day of the trip, I chose a day trip to Macau. As a fellow Special Administrative Region of the "one country, two systems", Macau is known to have a very high HDI and life expectancy, with a very dense visiting population of degenerate Han baccarat players. Because of all this and a comparative lack of building regulations, Macau is a pretty interesting place to visit.</p>
                    <p>Having decided to take a high speed ferry both ways to avoid the awful traffic and immigration checkpoints in Zhuhai, we then took a taxi to the Londoner casino in Cotai.</p>
                    <p>These casinos are generally nicer and cleaner than their Vegas counterparts, which makes sense since they serve a wealthier demographic, but they still carried the same depressing feeling I generally get from casinos. After indulging in Lord Stow's "famous" egg tarts and Portuguese food, we headed out of the casino district to visit the historic colonial district of Macau.</p>
                    <p>Ruínas de São Paulo, apparently one of the "Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World", was infested with tourists. We also visited the lighthouse and chapel on Guia Hill.</p>
                    <p>Making the trek back to the Outer Harbor, we took an earlier ferry back to Hong Kong. Now, these Boeing 929 hydrojet-powered hydrofoils look pretty cool and red on the exterior, but the ride was awful. There's definitely a reason why the US Naval patrolboats based on this technology never took off. Me and Jerry were holding on for dear life, trying to not to puke up our lunch.</p>
                    <p>Having decided on the traditional Chinese meal of pizza for dinner, we then headed out to the Happy Valley Racecourse for the evening. Built in 1845 for British Hong Kongers, gambling on horse races became unsurprisingly popular with the Chinese locals. Free entry for foreigners was the cherry on top.</p>

                    <h3>Day 3 - The New Territories</h3>
                    <p>Built in 2006 to induce more tourism to Lantau Island, the Ngong Ping 360 Italian-built gondola offered some crazy bay and mountain views. Sadly, this was the best part of the excursion, since the village and the big Buddha at the top were underwhelming to say the least.</p>
                    <p>As it was Christmas Eve, we spent the evening on Hong Kong Island bar hopping and sight seeing. I managed to get reservations to some current and former bars on the "World's 50 Best Bars" list, which made me realize how much I disliked pretentious avant garde cocktails. At least they were near some Wong Kar-wai landmarks like the Midnight Express 7-11.</p>

                    <h3>Day 4</h3>
                    <p>So yeah, turns out taking a late night international flight sucks. Sadly, not very many places have the same coin locker culture as in Japan, so we had to hunt down a place in a high-end mall to hold our stuff.</p>
                    <p>Since our flight departed HKG at 8:30 in the evening, it meant we had to land in mainland China at 11 PM. Turns out, customs agents aren't any friendlier in the evening than they are during the day.</p>
                    <p>Now a quick aside, China has mostly moved to a digital payments society with the vast majority of people using either Weixin (WeChat) or Alipay. Since the payments portion of these apps are mainly aimed at mainlanders, they were a huge pain to set up. Weixin was deceptively easy to set up at first, but some accounts were randomly required to have an existing user approve your enrollment. But once this was done, it worked for the most part. Alipay, on the other hand, required me to contact customer support to upload a photo of me holding my passport as well as a closeup of my face for "real-name verification." Unlike Weixin though, Alipay worked 100% of the time (as long as my network connection was good enough). In some cities, foreigners weren't able to use Weixin for public transport.</p>
                    <p>Both apps, however, were able to automagically translate the Chinese interfaces of their mini-apps, such as Didi for ridehailing and Meituan for food delivery. As it was midnight when we finally left the Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport, we had Mister Deng call the taxi instead.</p>
                    <p>Our hotel in Chongqing was IHG's InterContinental Chongqing Raffles City. Designed by the same architect as the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, this hotel was on the top ~20 floors of one of the towers in probably the most iconic building in the Chongqing skyline. However, since it sat right at the tip of peninsula between the Jialing and Yangtze rivers, it wasn't really convenient for sightseeing. And even though the metro station was directly underneath the hotel complex, to actually get to the hotel we had to go up multiple escalators, up one elevator to the sky lobby 42nd floor, and finally transfer to the hotel elevators.</p>

                    <h3>Day 5</h3>
                    <p>A day of letdowns and disappointments. Chongqing definitely felt like a city designed for short-form online videos, since most of the landmarks looked better on TikTok or Reels. The Kuixing Building, where the ground-level square is actually the 22nd floor of the building, or Hangyancun Sta., the deepest railway station in the world, or even Liziba Sta. where the train goes through a building, were cool in concept but underwhelming in person. We did get some good beef noodles in Singapore-style botanical mall though.</p>

                    <h3>Day 6</h3>
                    <p>Another day of checking off sightseeing destinations. Hongyadong, Chongqing Art Museum exterior, Shibati, all kind of interesting to see at first. But they also felt curated and designed specifically for photographs rather than any substance. We decided to look for cultural fulfilment in a cat cafe instead.</p>
                    <p>The shining example of this is probably Pipa Yuan, the gigantic hot pot restaurant that takes up most of a mountain. I saw this place all over Xiaohongshu, with people raving about how it holds the Guinness record for the biggest hot pot restaurant in the world. However, it took forever to get to since it was in the middle of nowhere, with non-existent views and aggressively mediocre food.</p>
                    <p>The only redeeming landmark of Chongqing is probably the view of Hongyadong, Huanghuayuan Bridge and the rest of Yuzhong District lit up at night.</p>

                    <h3>Day 7 - Train to Chengdu</h3>
                    <p>Trains in China are a hassle. For metros, you have to pass through a metal detector and get your bag scanned every time you enter the platform, friction which adds up every time you want to go anywhere. And China's high speed rail network, although extensive, is a pain to use. First off, tickets are only available 14 days before departure, which means there's a mad dash to book right when the tickets drop. Additionally, it's annoying for foreigners to use the official 12306 service to buy tickets, which means using an OTA like Trip.com (the global facing site for the Chinese mega-agent Ctrip), is the simplest way to book tickets. But as I found out trying to buy train tickets from Hong Kong to Chongqing, tickets aren't guaranteed by Trip.com since they have to purchase the tickets themselves. And of course, you're unable to select your seats either.</p>
                    <p>Our tickets to Chengdu had us depart from the brand new Chongqing East Sta. Newly opened in June 2025, this is the largest railway station in the world. It might also be the least dense, since only 3 of the ~26 gates had trains scheduled when we arrived. Even though no restaurants had been built yet, fortunately there was a 7-11 and a Lawsons open for provisions.</p>
                    <p>We were taking G2448 to Chengdu, which is a CRH200A Hexie trainset based on the Japanese E2 Series Shinkansen. This technology was (forcibly) acquired via technology transfer, which the Chinese later used to jumpstart their subsequent Fuxing EMUs. Even though this was an older trainset, it was fine for the 2 hour trip.</p>
                    <p>Chinese HSR trains come in 3 classes: 2nd Class, Business Class, and 1st class in ascending order. Since tickets are more expensive, it's easier for foreigners to find availability for Business Class or 1st Class tickets.</p>
                    <p>For Chengdu, we stayed at the ISEYA Serviced Apartments in Taikoo Li. It was an AirBnb-sized unit, with a full kitchen and living room, and a combo washer-dryer, but it was like a hotel where it had a lobby for check-in and daily housekeeping. We were basically in the Time Square of the city, with multiple malls and a great metro station near our building.</p>
                    <p>Nearby, the Sino-Ocean Taikoo Li outdoor mall might just be the most aesthetic mall I've been to. It's chocked full of all your high-end brands, and also has a supermarket in the basement below.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon, we walked east towards the Jin River and along its banks, to the Anshun Bridge. Marco Polo wrote about one of the earlier incarnations of this bridge, but it has been reconstructed multiple times for flood and tourism purposes. This one was finished in 2003 and includes a restaurant. We stopped by the supermarket for some snacks and the traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage 'Peach Strong Zero'.</p>

                    <h3>Day 8 - City Walk</h3>
                    <p>It was a lazy morning, so me and Zach went on a morning stroll from our hotel in Taikoo Li to visit the Chairman in the Tianfu Square. Chengdu is a bit different in the early morning, with most people going to work or preparing for the influx of tourists later in the day. The square was just flat and empty with a giant statue of the Chairman, so we took a subway to the People's Park instead.</p>
                    <p>One of the things the Chengdu People's Park is known for is the matchmaking market. Once approved, people can hang their "resumes" describing themselves, with the hopes that a passersby will be intrigued enough to reach out to the included phone number. It was quite entertaining even if I read the descriptions via Google Translate.</p>
                    <p>Later on in the afternoon, we made our way to New Century Global Center just south of the city center. This is a monolith of a building, it's the "third-largest building measured by floor area", just a massive complex featuring a mall, indoor water park, IMAX theater, multiple hotels etc etc. The inside was weirdly empty and aged, which was surprising for a complex completed in 2013. I guess upkeep is difficult when your owner gets arrested on "corruption" charges.</p>
                    <p>Across the street were the "Towers of Life", concrete waterfalls made to resemble RGB stalks of bamboo. Definitely social media bait, but made for some good photos too.</p>

                    <h3>Day 9 - Panda Research Base</h3>
                    <p>Today we were visiting the pride of Chengdu, and maybe even the whole of China. The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding is home to around 100 Giant pandas, as well red pandas and a select number of other wild and endangered species. This institution is in charge important tasks such as threatening to revoke pandas loaned to foreign zoos to politically coerce their governments, showing pandas panda-porn to get them in the mood for reproduction, and sticking metal rods in the anus of male pandas and electrocuting them to make them forcibly ejaculate.</p>
                    <p>Then we had Dicos for lunch, and went shopping for Umamusume trading cards.</p>

                    <h3>Day 10 - Train to Xi'an</h3>
                    <p>We checked out of our hotel, and went straight to Chengdu East Sta. This time, we were riding one of China Railway Chengdu Group's Fuxing EMUs, two 8-car CR400AF–S trainsets linked together to form a 16 car train. The Fuxing line of trains are the first to be made with domestic technology, allowing them to be exported for use in Indonesia. Although technically faster, I generally prefer the slightly slower N700A/S trains used on the Tokaido Shinkansen. These Japanese trains have tilting capability, making them more expensive to manufacture but also more comfortable to ride in. I also found their interiors to be more refined than their Chinese counterparts.</p>
                    <p>Xi'an was just cold and wet, with sleet coming down every now and then. We hailed another Didi from the garage at Xi'an North Sta. and made our way through the dreary grey Xi'an winter to our hotel.</p>
                    <p>This time, we're staying at HUALUXE Xi'an Tanghua. IHG created this upscale brand for the Chinese domestic market, and it seems their goal is to combine Chinese cultural design and hospitality with the scale and straightforwardness of international brands.</p>
                    <p>This particular one was located near the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, a Tang Dynasty Buddhist pagoda built to hold sutras and figurines of Gautama Buddha. Built during the golden age of the Tang Dynasty and the so-called "Pax Sinica", the pagoda easily towers above all of the buildings in the surrounding park. Sadly, it was closed during our time in Xi'an.</p>
                    <p>As it was New Year's Eve, we tried to go to the old city wall of Xi'an. Sadly, wall was closed to pedestrians and access to the old city was limited to just foot traffic, even some metro stations were shut down.</p>
                    <p>Instead, we just drank convenience store Svedka and cigarettes, and went to bed at 9 pm local.</p>

                    <h3>Day 11 - Qin Shi Huang's Mausoleum</h3>
                    <p>The main attraction in Xi'an. This massive necropolis is home to the famed Terracotta Army, and is located in the outskirts of Xi'an proper. Built in the 3rd century BCE, craftsmen aimed crossbows and arrows designed to kill anyone entering the throne, and it is said that the tomb contains rivers of mercury to simulate the Yangtze and the Yellow Rivers. As soon as construction was finished and the treasures set into place, the Second Emperor had the outer gate lowered, trapping all of the workers inside to prevent anyone from leaking the secrets of the traps.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, in typical Chinese 5A attraction fashion, we were packed to the gills.</p>
                    <p>After some biangbiangmen, we went to cycle the Xi'an City Walls.</p>
                    <p>The bikes available were in terrible condition, making it a bit uncomfortable to bike along 14th century cobble walls.</p>
                    <p>We spent the evening buying some last minute gear to outfit ourselves for Harbin, and had a nice traditional McDonald's meal for dinner.</p>

                    <h3>Day 12 - Huashan</h3>
                    <p>Even though we're staying in the same region, we're changing hotels. With all our gear, we're headed to Huashan North Sta. on another Hexie, a CR380B. This time we're trying out the first class cabin. There's only 10 first class seats per train, with each cabin being at the very front and back of the train. Even though both cabins were empty when we arrived, 3 people were given seats in the rear cabin, and I was assigned to the front cabin. Power reclining seats and a quiet cabin, similar to business class on a long haul flight.</p>
                    <p>After dumping our stuff at a luggage counter at Huashan, we took the shuttle to the base of the mountain, and the gondola up.</p>
                    <p>This was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. The gondola to the west peak takes about 20 minutes, and some of the gaps between the towers were insane. Built by French engineers using Swiss cables, this gondola opened in 2014 with around 4200 meters of diagonal length and a vertical rise of 894 meters. The views from the trail were incredible.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, this too was a 5A attraction, which meant we had to fight against hordes of visitors to get anywhere.</p>
                    <p>After going back down the same gondola, we ended taking a taxi to our 2nd hotel in Xi'an.</p>
                    <p>The area around Huaqing Palace has been in use for millennia, starting with the Zhou dynasty in the 10th century BCE. Subsequent dynasties made use of the hot springs in the area, but we found our private outdoor "hot" spring to be to be tepid at best.</p>

                    <h3>Day 13 - Flight to Harbin</h3>
                    <p>We woke up a bit early so we could enjoy the included breakfast and the premises. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek stayed at the resort in 1936, when one of his generals launched a coup and turned him over to the CCP forces.</p>
                    <p>Our flight to Harbin was uneventful, but having to board a bus on the tarmac in near 0F conditions was brutal. We had our winter clothing delivered to our hotel, so I made sure to book a private airport transfer so we wouldn't have to faff around with a cab in such cold conditions.</p>
                    <p>This time, we were staying the Harbin Central Street Atour. Atour is a domestic hotel brand, with various sub-brands at all different scales. They prioritize providing a high-tech experience, with domestic appliances and toiletries (for better and for worse). The smart toilet kept clogging, and the hotel restricted the thermostat to a minimum of 78F, which made it uncomfortably hot at night. We later found out that this was policy for most hotels in China during the winter, which was bizarre.</p>
                    <p>Harbin's Central Street is lined with bollards to prevent cars from entering, and there were all sorts of domestic and foreign tourists walking around late into the evening. Our hotel was in an excellent location overlooking the street, which was fun until we realized the carnival music they played on the speakers wouldn't stop until close to midnight.</p>
                    <p>Bundling up, we went to Haidilao for dinner. We also saw an ice sculpture of the snow king.</p>

                    <h3>Day 14 - Songhua River</h3>
                    <p>The Songhua River deeply freezes during the winter, with the ice thick enough for snowmobiles, automobiles, trucks, hovercraft and any other sort of motorized and non-motorized vehicles to drive on.</p>
                    <p>Standing around in the ice starts sapping your body heat through your feet, and the cold winds made it especially tough to spend more than a few hours outside each day.</p>
                    <p>The day ended with a early Meituan dinner and some domestic beers.</p>

                    <h3>Day 15 - Harbin Ice and Snow World</h3>
                    <p>Yeah, spending 3 nights in such a brutally cold city was a mistake. Having checked out Saint Sophia's Church after a late start, we had lunch at a DIY noodle restaurant, before heading out to the Ice and Snow World.</p>
                    <p>The park is huge. Massive ice sculptures, giant ice slides, with a stage for a rave as well as giant ferris wheel. Having spent 2 nights in Harbin already and more than 2 weeks traveling, we were so fatigued we couldn't really appreciate the scale of it all.</p>
                    <p>For the more in-demand activities like the mega ice slide or the ferris wheel, you're required claim a ticket for a 1 hour slot, which opens at the top of the hour. Since we were using eSIMs however, our network connection was so de-prioritized that by the time the webpage loaded, all 1200 tickets for that slot was claimed already.</p>
                    <p>There's barely any seating available, and there were no stores selling water or anything of that sort. The few restaurants they had available were packed full of people trying to get out of the cold.</p>
                    <p>After finding a nice indoor hiding spot, we waited until it got darker before going back out to see sculptures illuminated. This was much more worth it, I would have preferred waiting until the afternoon before visiting.</p>

                    <h3>Day 16 - Flight to Shanghai</h3>
                    <p>At this point, we're just trying to hang on to our sanity at this point. Our flight from Harbin had us land at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport. There's many ways to get into the city center, but I wanted to take the Shanghai Maglev into the city center.</p>
                    <p>Built using German Transrapid technology, this is the first commercial implementation of magnetic levitation technology. While the system initially had a cruising speed of 431 km/h (268 mph), this was reduced in 2021 to a more pedestrian 300 km/h (186 mph).</p>
                    <p>That being said, it seems the service is pretty slow, with one train every 20-30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>For our last hotel, we're staying at Hyatt's Caption brand in Zhongshan Park. This sub-brand typically has a large work-friendly common area next to the lobby, for both guests and visitors to enjoy. The one here has a big cafe where breakfast was served as well.</p>
                    <p>Dinner was in a private room at a Shanghainese restaurant, courtesy of Mister Deng's cousin Maggie. I was very grateful for her help smoothing over some of the logistic and hotel issues that we had.</p>

                    <h3>Day 17</h3>
                    <p>This was another slight death march day, which we haven't done for a while. The mild Shanghai winters and the approaching date of departure gave everyone a second wind.</p>
                    <p>The first landmark on our list was Jing'an Temple. Originally built during the Three Kingdoms era, it was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times in classic Chinese fashion. There was a queue of people outside with timed entry tickets, which was quite beyond my effort threshold at this part of the trip, so we just took pictures from the top of the Apple store across the street.</p>
                    <p>Wukang Road. Probably one of areas of Shanghai that best embodies the former French Concession. With wide tree-lined boulevards and quiet streets, it was really pleasant stroll.</p>
                    <p>Wukang Mansion is the building that best showcases what the former French Concession really entails. Built in the French Renaissance style, it is also known "The Diving Board", since many members of the intelligentsia killed themselves here during the Cultural Revolution. The building can best be enjoyed at the Chagee right across the street.</p>
                    <p>Lunch was at Fu He Hui, a two Michelin-star restaurant and apparently the 15th best restaurant in all of Asia.</p>
                    <p>A walk down Nanjing Rd., and into some sketchy anime malls. We later met up with Maggie at the Shanghai location of Bar Leone, recently ranked as the best bar in the world.</p>
                    <p>Back out for a night stroll by the Bund, part of the former British Concession.</p>

                    <h3>Day 18</h3>
                    <p>Fatigue and burnout is all catching up. Mainly just a day of shopping, we split up to buy our last few souvenirs of the trip, and took it really easy.</p>
                    <p>Dinner was at a North Korean restaurant. It seemed like it was restaurant policy to profile every guest, to make sure no Korean guests (North or South), were present. We made sure to make a reservation just before the performances started, during which photography was prohibited. They did let us take pictures during the birthday celebration part.</p>

                    <h3>Day 19</h3>
                    <p>Last day. Me and Zach woke up (relatively) early and went to a third-wave coffeeshop near our hotel. I'd seen it every time we got to our hotel, but they only opened up after renovations on our last day. Best coffee I've had in all of China.</p>
                    <p>Again, another day of aimless wandering in Shanghai, until dinner with more of Mister Deng's family.</p>
                    <p>Then the Xiaomi store.</p>

                    <h3>Day 20</h3>
                    <p>Get me tf home.</p>
                    <p>The end.</p>
